# jelwin-git.github.io
Application was created to test out "Numbers API".
This project uses primarily html and javascript.
* Used bulma.io for styling
* Used numbersAPI from "http://numbersapi.com/"

## Installation
No installation is needed.
After project has been downloaded, launch the .html page from the directory (using a browser)

## Usage

```node.js
Clicking on "find facts" will search the number in the input area.

Clicking 'randomize!' will input a random number into the input area and bring up the facts.

Clicking 'next' on 'math facts' will provide another math fact.

Clicking 'next' on 'trivia facts' will provide another trivia fact.
```
Please note that 'next' will not keep a record of which facts have been encountered.
If you are unlucky (or the API does not have a wide range of facts); it will present the same fact
